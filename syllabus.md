## Course Description

The goal of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of computer programming: what it is, where it is used, who does it, and how YOU can do it too! Computer Science (CS) is fast becoming one of the most popular areas of study at colleges worldwide (including Brown University!). It is popular for its widespread application to industry, non-profit, and educational sector post-graduate jobs, as well as its implications in a world that is growing more and more reliant on advances in digital technology. However, because of its relatively new conception compared to other STEM majors like math or biology, many high schools do not offer introductory courses in CS or have associated resources, so it can be hard to know whether coding is something you’d be interested in.

Using the programming language Python, this course will cover the fundamentals of coding. Topics will include logical thinking, how to store data in code, what functions are and how to leverage them, working with code others have written, sharing your own code, and analyzing and visualizing large datasets. You will be exposed to all the necessary syntactic knowledge you need to become proficient at coding in Python, in addition to gaining an appreciation for the many ways coding is used in the real world. Python is used for its readability and popularity for both college courses and employers.

Coursework will include collaborative labs, interest-driven projects, and opportunities for individual exploration. Through this course, you will not only learn the basics of coding, but you will also be introduced to the larger coding community and become experienced in writing, fixing, and improving your own code. Like learning a new spoken/written language, learning a coding language works best in an immersive environment so this summer course provides a perfect opportunity to begin your programming journey, and a supportive cohort to begin that journey with.

### Who should take this course?
This course requires no coding background or prior knowledge, and is in fact designed for complete beginners. Students with any level of background are welcome, but those who already possess a strong foundation in coding (for example, those who have taken an AP CS class or equivalent) may benefit more from other courses in the catalog.


## Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will be equipped with the tools to take your coding to the next level, whether that be a new language, more advanced topics or classes, or writing your own Python code to help automate your life! With a strong computational and theoretical foundation in programming, a whole new world of personal, educational, and professional opportunities will open up to you.

### Learning Outcomes
Students who complete this course will be able to:
- Translate programming goals into formal language with enough detail for a computer to run
- Practice and build the skills to learn new packages/languages and solve novel coding problems without use of a formal textbook or class
- Use a structured approach for researching, designing, writing, and testing code to solve novel problems, both alone and in collaboration with peers
- Program solutions to tasks/problems from their own disciplines or real world experiences, and identify parts of their life/discipline which already rely on programming


## Course Outline and Activities
### Time Allocation
I expect this course to total approximately 55 hours of work-time. This includes:
- 0.5 hours (~15 minutes weekly) reading announcements and assignments posted on Canvas
- 30 hours in class (includes in-class activities) 
- 25 hours (2-3 hours per night) of preparation for the following class and working on your final project. This will likely include time spent in optional office hours

All course material will be distributed through Canvas. Each day’s activities will be submitted through this medium. Any lecture slides will be made available the day before via canvas.
