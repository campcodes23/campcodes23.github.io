## Course Description

The goal of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of computer programming: what it is, where it is used, who does it, and how YOU can do it too! Computer Science (CS) is fast becoming one of the most popular areas of study at colleges worldwide (including Brown University!). It is popular for its widespread application to industry, non-profit, and educational sector post-graduate jobs, as well as its implications in a world that is growing more and more reliant on advances in digital technology. However, because of its relatively new conception compared to other STEM majors like math or biology, many high schools do not offer introductory courses in CS or have associated resources, so it can be hard to know whether coding is something you’d be interested in.

Using the programming language Python, this course will cover the fundamentals of coding. Topics will include logical thinking, how to store data in code, what functions are and how to leverage them, working with code others have written, sharing your own code, and analyzing and visualizing large datasets. You will be exposed to all the necessary syntactic knowledge you need to become proficient at coding in Python, in addition to gaining an appreciation for the many ways coding is used in the real world. Python is used for its readability and popularity for both college courses and employers.

Coursework will include collaborative labs, interest-driven projects, and opportunities for individual exploration. Through this course, you will not only learn the basics of coding, but you will also be introduced to the larger coding community and become experienced in writing, fixing, and improving your own code. Like learning a new spoken/written language, learning a coding language works best in an immersive environment so this summer course provides a perfect opportunity to begin your programming journey, and a supportive cohort to begin that journey with.

### Who should take this course?
This course requires no coding background or prior knowledge, and is in fact designed for complete beginners. Students with any level of background are welcome, but those who already possess a strong foundation in coding (for example, those who have taken an AP CS class or equivalent) may benefit more from other courses in the catalog.


## Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will be equipped with the tools to take your coding to the next level, whether that be a new language, more advanced topics or classes, or writing your own Python code to help automate your life! With a strong computational and theoretical foundation in programming, a whole new world of personal, educational, and professional opportunities will open up to you.

### Learning Outcomes
Students who complete this course will be able to:
- Translate programming goals into formal language with enough detail for a computer to run
- Practice and build the skills to learn new packages/languages and solve novel coding problems without use of a formal textbook or class
- Use a structured approach for researching, designing, writing, and testing code to solve novel problems, both alone and in collaboration with peers
- Program solutions to tasks/problems from their own disciplines or real world experiences, and identify parts of their life/discipline which already rely on programming


## Course Outline and Activities
### Time Allocation
I expect this course to total approximately 55 hours of work-time. This includes:
- 0.5 hours (~15 minutes weekly) reading announcements and assignments posted on Canvas
- 30 hours in class (includes in-class activities) 
- 25 hours (2-3 hours per night) of preparation for the following class and working on your final project. This will likely include time spent in optional office hours

All course material will be distributed through Canvas. Each day’s activities will be submitted through this medium. Any lecture slides will be made available the day before via canvas.

### Details on Assignments
*Final Project:* For your final project you will visualize a dataset using the Python skills you have acquired during the course. Details for this assignment will be released on July 14th (Day 5) and will be reviewed in class.

*In-Class Activities:* During the course you may be asked to work in small groups or individually to complete reflections, small programming assignments, and other course activities. Please plan to bring your laptop to class with you to complete these, along with a charging cord if you anticipate needing to charge the machine during a three hour session.

*Out-of-class Assignments:* Between classes, we will provide activities to supplement and practice what you have learned that day in class. These should take about 2-3 hours per evening, and we will offer office hours (see info below!) for you to complete them during if you want assistance or to work in a group. 

## Classroom Environment
It is my intention to make this course accessible and valuable for all students, regardless of their background in computer science or personal identity. I aim to promote discussions and collaborations which harness and benefit from the diversity of students who will be in the classroom. However, intentions are not always met and it is the impact of my teaching practices which will matter for your learning and growth as programmers. With this in mind, if there are things you think I should start or stop doing to create a more inclusive classroom or syllabus, I hope that you feel comfortable bringing your ideas to me or a TA so that we can work together to improve this course. And if anyone in our class makes you feel like you do not belong in CS or are not a “real” programmer, I hope you can bring that information to me so I can take appropriate action – you DO belong here as much as anyone else. 

### Respectful Learning Environment
In addition to the scholarly expectations of this course are the interpersonal ones. You are expected to treat your fellow students with respect during class discussions, office hours, and when collaborating with them on projects. This means listening to their ideas and allowing for a varied group of voices to participate in class, and it also means respecting their position in the room as learners just like you. See academic integrity section below for more information about working together, which will be heavily encouraged. But in this class, working together does not mean using the answer from whomever solves the problem the quickest. It means helping each other come to the solution together, appreciating that our peers may be faster or slower on any given topic than ourselves, and not robbing fellow students of the time they need to understand and execute code themselves. This will also allow for you to see multiple solutions to a problem -- there is always more than one way to code something! Please treat your classmates the way you would want to be treated, as someone who is putting in the time and deserves to learn from this course.

### Office Hours
Office hours are designated times that your instructors set aside to engage with questions that may come up during class or on assignments. They are on a drop-in basis (meaning you do NOT have to stay for the whole hour - you can come and go as you please - and you do not need to tell us ahead of time you will come) and are for your benefit. Office hours are a staple of all college courses and are an incredibly helpful resource to get to know your instructors and engage with the material in a deeper way. They’re also a great opportunity to work on your assignments with your peers. Please stop in to see us during our hours!

### Academic Integrity
All students, faculty and staff are expected to follow the University’s guidelines and policies on academic integrity. For students, this means following the standards of academic honesty when writing assignments, citing and using source material appropriately and collaborating with fellow students. Ensure that the work you submit for grading represents your own honest efforts. Plagiarism representing someone else’s work as your own or submitting work that you have previously submitted for marks in another class or program is a serious offense that can result in sanctions. See Brown’s Pre-College Program code of conduct for the University’s expectations on academic honesty and integrity: https://precollege.brown.edu/policies#conduct

**Copied material (code or otherwise) without citation of the author, whether verbatim or not, will be treated as plagiarism.** If you have any questions about plagiarizing code, please speak with me.
